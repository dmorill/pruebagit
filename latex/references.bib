@book{Artigues2008,
abstract = {This title presents a large variety of models and algorithms dedicated to the resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP), which aims at scheduling at minimal duration a set of activities subject to precedence constraints and limited resource availabilities. In the first part, the standard variant of RCPSP is presented and analyzed as a combinatorial optimization problem. Constraint programming and integer linear programming formulations are given. Relaxations based on these formulations and also on related scheduling problems are presented. Exact methods and heuristics are surveyed. Computational experiments, aiming at providing an empirical insight on the difficulty of the problem, are provided. The second part of the book focuses on several other variants of the RCPSP and on their solution methods. Each variant takes account of real-life characteristics which are not considered in the standard version, such as possible interruptions of activities, production and consumption of resources, cost-based approaches and uncertainty considerations. The last part presents industrial case studies where the RCPSP plays a central part. Applications are presented in various domains such as assembly shop and rolling ingots production scheduling, project management in information technology companies and instruction scheduling for VLIW processor architectures.

abstract = {This paper presents a scheduling solution for electrical load tracking of a steel plant. In the scheduling problem the electricity consumption of the plant is pre-specified by an energy curve. During production all tasks must be scheduled such that the total electricity consumption of all machines tracks the scheduled consumption as closely as possible while respecting all production constraints. All energy over- and underconsumption is penalized since it results in fines from the electricity producer. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer programming problem. The scheduling model uses a continuous time formulation. The model is tested on production data from industry. The results show that the continuous time scheduling model can be successfully applied for the electrical load tracking scheduling of a steel plant. By using this type of scheduling the plant owner can potentially minimize over- and underconsumption and thereby reduce his costs.},

abstract = {Electricity demand response has been considered as a critical methodology to realize the strategy of sustainable development for manufacturing enterprises by effectively reducing the increasing electricity demand and Greenhouse Gas emissions. Most existing studies about the electricity demand response implementation focus on either the supply side management, e.g., policy making, price setting, or the customer side applications for the end-users in residential and commercial building sectors. As for the industrial sector, only a few papers utilizing the long term scheduling methodology to reduce the electricity consumption during peak periods are available. Little work has been implemented on the decision-making for the real time electricity demand response in industrial manufacturing systems considering system throughput constraint. In this paper, an analytical model is established to identify the optimal energy control actions and estimate the potential capacity of power demand reduction of typical manufacturing systems during the period of demand response event without compromising system production. Markov Decision Process is used to model the complex interaction between the adopted demand control actions and the system state evolutions. A numerical case study on a section of an automotive assembly line is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {This work addresses the scheduling of continuous single stage multiproduct plants with parallel units and shared storage tanks. Processing tasks are energy intensive and we consider time-dependent electricity pricing and availability together with multiple intermediate due dates, handled as hard constraints. A new discrete-time aggregate formulation is proposed to rapidly plan the production levels. It is combined with a continuous-time model for detailed scheduling as the essential part of a rolling-horizon algorithm. Their computational performance is compared to traditional discrete and continuous-time full-space formulations with all models relying on the Resource-Task Network (RTN) process representation. The results show that the new models and algorithm can generate global optimal schedules much more efficiently than their counterparts in problems involving unlimited power availability. Under restricted power, the aggregate model underestimates the electricity cost, which may cause the rolling-horizon approach to converge to a suboptimal solution, becoming the discrete-time model a better approach.},

abstract = {To meet utility demands some industrial units use onsite utility system. Traditionally, the management of such type of industrial units is carried out in three sequential steps: scheduling of the manufacturing unit by minimizing inventory, estimating the utility needs of manufacturing unit and finally operation planning of the utility system. This article demonstrates the value of an integrated approach which couples the scheduling of manufacturing unit with operational planning of the utility system. A discrete-time mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed to compare traditional and integrated approaches. Results indicate that the integrated approach leads to significant reduction in energy costs and at the same time decreases the emissions of harmful gases.},

EES approaches are scheduling approaches that have the objective of improving energy efficiency. Based on an iterative methodology, we review, analyze, and synthesize the current state of the literature and propose a completely new research framework to structure the research field. In doing so, the three dimensions “energetic coverage”, “energy supply”, and “energy demand” are introduced and used to classify the literature. Each of these dimensions contains categories and attributes to specify energy-related characteristics that are relevant for EES. We further provide an empirical analysis of the reviewed literature and emphasize the benefits that can be achieved by EES in practice.},

Project Scheduling: A Research Handbook has been divided into four parts. Part I consists of three chapters on the scope and relevance of project scheduling, on the nature of project scheduling, and finally on the introduction of a unified scheme that will be used in subsequent chapters for the identification and classification of the project scheduling problems studied in this book. Part II focuses on the time analysis of project networks. Part III carries the discussion further into the crucial topic of scheduling under scarce resources. Part IV deals with robust scheduling and stochastic scheduling issues. Numerous tables and figures are used throughout the book to enhance the clarity and effectiveness of the discussions. For the interested and motivated reader, the problems at the end of each chapter should be considered as an integral part of the presentation.},

Time/cost behaviour in a project activity basically describes the trade-off between the duration of the activity and its amount of non-renewable resources (e.g., money) committed to it. In the discrete version of the problem (the discrete time/cost trade-off problem), it is generally accepted that the trade-off follows a discrete non-increasing pattern, i.e., expediting an activity is possible by allocating more resources (i.e., at a larger cost) to it. However, due to its complexity, the problem has been solved for relatively small instances.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a new metaheuristic algorithm for the resource-constrained project-scheduling problem. The procedure is a non-standard implementation of fundamental concepts of tabu search without explicitly using memory structures embedded in a population-based framework. The procedure makes use of a fan search strategy to intensify the search, whereas a strategic oscillation mechanism loosely related to the forward/backward technique provides the necessary diversification. Our implementation employs the topological order (TO) representation of schedules. To explore the TO vector space we introduce three types of moves, two of them based on the concept of relative criticality, and a third one based on multi-pass sampling ideas. The strategic utilisation of probabilities for move construction is another distinguishing feature of our approach. Extensive computational testing with more than 2000 problem instances shows the merit of the proposed solution method.},

abstract = {Abstract The problem addressed in this paper is the non-preemptive resource-constrained project scheduling problem in which the duration of each activity depends on the amount of resources allocated to its execution, and the objective is to minimize the overall project duration. It is also assumed that resources are limited but renewable from period to period. Twenty-one heuristic scheduling rules are compared on 240 test problems divided into two main groups containing 50 and 100 activities, respectively. Each group contains one-resource, two-resource and four-resource problems. The results of the comparative study allow us to identify the most efficient heuristics and suggest a combination of five-heuristics which have a high probability (229 over 240) of giving the best (among the 21 solutions obtained) solution.},

abstract = {The discrete time–cost tradeoff problem (DTCTP) is an important subject in the project scheduling theory and applications. Due to the fact that the resources used in projects in modern enterprises mainly belong to renewable resources, e.g. manpower resources, the general DTCTP is extended to a new multi-mode resource-constrained DTCTP model (MRC-DTCTP). The multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem (MRCPSP) was referred and the renewable resource constraints were added to the general DTCTP. By predefining the resource price, the renewable resources are related to the project costs, including direct cost and indirect cost. Every activity can be executed in the crashing way in which the project direct costs are used to shorten the activity duration. According to the characteristics of the MRC-DTCTP, an improved genetic algorithm for solving it was developed and its effectiveness was verified by compared with the exact algorithm. Finally an entire time–cost tradeoff curve for a project network was drawn through computing project deadline problem, and the advantages of the MRC-DTCTP were investigated based on computation results.},

General temporal constraints (arising from minimum and maximum time lags between project activities) and several different types of limited resources are considered. A large variety of time-based, financial, and resource-based objectives important in practice are studied. A thorough structural analysis of the feasible region of project scheduling problems and a classification and detailed investigation of objective functions are performed, which can be exploited for developing efficient exact and heuristic solution methods. New interesting applications of project scheduling to production and operations management as well as investment projects are discussed in the second edition.

We introduce so-called partially renewable resources by assuming for each resource a capacity on subsets of periods. The concept of partially renewable resources is a fundamental tool in order to make, e.g., timetabling and shift scheduling aspects, amenable to project scheduling. In addition, partially renewable resources serve to model complicated labor regulations. Furthermore, they cover traditional renewable and nonrenewable resource constraints as special cases. We consider makespan minimization as objective. For the exact solution of the problem we employ a basic enumeration scheme. In order to speed up convergence, we formulate bounds which take into account future resource consumption of partially renewable resources. Moreover, we generalize the serial scheduling scheme in order to get fast approximation methods. A rigorous assessment of the procedures is provided by solving ProGen instances generated u...},

abstract = {This paper considers the multimode resource-constrained project-scheduling problem (MRCPSP) with a minimum-makespan objective. An exact branch and cut algorithm is presented based on the integer linear programming (ILP) formulation of the problem. In the preprocessing stage, lower bounds on the distance between each pair of precedence-constrained activities are derived. These bounds are used to reduce the number of variables in the model and to generate cuts that tighten the linear programming relaxation. The solution process is accelerated by an adaptive branching scheme in conjunction with a bound-tightening scheme that is called iteratively after branching. To find good feasible solutions in the early stages of the computations, a high-level neighborhood search strategy known as local branching is included. Here, a neighborhood of a feasible solution is defined by the linear inequalities in the ILP model and is searched first. As implemented, the full algorithm is exact rather than heuristic in nature....},

abstract = {China and India, the world's fastest growing energy markets, are the special focus of the 2007 edition in the award-winning World Energy Outlook (WEO) series. How fast will demand in these dynamic economies rise? How will it be met? And what impact will their energy choices have on the rest of the world? Incorporating a global update of the WEO mid- and long-term energy projections reflecting the latest data, WEO 2007 also features 3 key energy scenarios to 2030: - the Reference Scenario shows the trends in surging energy consumption and CO2 emissions under existing government policies; - the Alternative Policy Scenario shows how policies driven by concerns for energy security, energy efficiency and the environment, under discussion but not yet adopted, could curb growth in energy demand; - the High Growth Scenario analyses what would happen to energy use if current high levels of economic growth in China and India persist through the projection period. New and more detailed models for both China and India allow a more comprehensive analysis of different future energy paths. WEO 2007 analyses the impact of rising energy use in these countries on: - international energy prices; - investment needs and financing arrangements; - energy-related greenhouse gas and other emissions; - and energy and non-energy international trade flows. The prospects for coal use, the role of nuclear, renewables, energy-efficiency improvements and urban and rural energy poverty in these two countries are all examined in depth. The work rests on close collaboration with public authorities and private organisations in China and India, as well as with key international organisations. As preparation for WEO 2007 the WEO team held the following 3 workshops: in China (see agenda), India (see agenda) and a high-level brainstorming in Paris.

We also introduce the preemptive extension of the problem which allows activity splitting (P-MRCPSP). To solve the problem, we apply a bi-population genetic algorithm, which makes use of two separate populations and extend the serial schedule generation scheme by introducing a mode improvement procedure. We evaluate the impact of preemption on the quality of the schedule and present detailed comparative computational results for the MRCPSP, which reveal that our procedure is amongst the most competitive algorithms.},

abstract = {We demonstrate enhancements of performance and energy efficiency of cutting tools by deposition of diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings on machine parts. DLC was deposited on steel drill bits, using plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) with the acetylene precursor diluted with argon, to produce a surface with low friction and low wear rate. Drill bit performance in dry drilling of aluminium was quantified by analysis of power consumption and swarf flow. Optimised deposition conditions produced drill bits with greatly enhanced performance over uncoated drill bits, showing a 25{\%} reduction in swarf clogging, a 36{\%} reduction in power consumption and a greater than five-fold increase in lifetime. Surface analysis with scanning electron microscopy shows that DLC coated drills exhibit much lower aluminium build up on the trailing shank of the drill, enhancing the anti-adhering properties of the drill and reducing heat generation during operation, resulting in the observed improvements in efficiency. Variation of drilling efficiency with argon dilution of precursor is related to changes in the microstructure of the DLC coating.},

Performing machining processes with better energy efficiency will, therefore, significantly reduce the total industrial consumption of energy. In this paper, a framework is presented to validate the introduction of energy consumption in the objectives of process planning for CNC machining. The state of the art in process planning and energy consumption in manufacturing research is utilised as a basis for the framework. A mathematical representation of the logic used is presented followed by two sets of experiments on energy consumption in machining to validate the logic. It is shown that energy consumption can be added to multi-criteria process planning systems as a valid objective and the discussion on using resource models for energy consumption estimation concludes the paper. These experiments represent a part test procedure machining proposal for the new environmental machine standard ISO 14955 Part 3.},

abstract = {Green Low-carbon development has been recognized as a key requirement for advanced manufacturing, and reducing the energy consumption of machining system is a critical aspect. Traditionally, process planning and scheduling were carried out separately and sequentially in manufacturing industry, which limits the work for energy-efficient machining system. Considering the fact that the functions of these two systems are usually complementary, the energy-saving of machining system can be further improved if they are tightly integrated. In this paper, an integration model based on nonlinear process planning (NLPP) is proposed to implement such energy-saving method, and the Therblig-based model is used to predict the energy consumption of machine tools in product manufacturing process. Then, a genetic algorithm-based approach is adopted to solve the established integration model. Given the alternative process schemes generated by NLPP, such integration model can help select the suitable process plan and machines for each job and generate the scheduling scheme simultaneously for saving energy. To verify the energy-saving effect and the performance of the algorithm, case studies have been conducted and the experimental results show that the energy-saving potential in a shop floor environment can be further enhanced through the integration of process planning and scheduling and the solution method is feasible.},

ANGEL combines ant colony optimization (ACO), genetic algorithm (GA) and local search strategy. The procedures of ANGEL are as follows. First, ACO searches the solution space and generates activity lists to provide the initial population for GA. Next, GA is executed and the pheromone set in ACO is updated when GA obtains a better solution. When GA terminates, ACO searches again by using a new pheromone set. ACO and GA search alternately and cooperatively in the solution space. This study also proposes an efficient local search procedure which is applied to yield a better solution when ACO or GA obtains a solution. A final search is applied upon the termination of ACO and GA. The experimental results of ANGEL on the standard sets of the project instances show that ANGEL is an effective method for solving the RCPSP. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We propose an efficient hybrid algorithm, known as ACOSS, for solving resource-constrained project scheduling problems (RCPSP) in real-time. The ACOSS algorithm combines a local search strategy, ant colony optimization (ACO), and a scatter search (SS) in an iterative process. In this process, ACO first searches the solution space and generates activity lists to provide the initial population for the SS algorithm. Then, the SS algorithm builds a reference set from the pheromone trails of the ACO, and improves these to obtain better solutions. Thereafter, the ACO uses the improved solutions to update the pheromone set. Finally in this iteration, the ACO searches the solution set using the new pheromone trails after the SS has terminated. In ACOSS, ACO and the SS share the solution space for efficient exchange of the solution set. The ACOSS algorithm is compared with state-of-the-art algorithms using a set of standard problems available in the literature. The experimental results validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The studied resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) is a classical well-known problem which involves resource, precedence, and temporal constraints and has been applied to many applications. However, the RCPSP is confirmed to be an NP-hard combinatorial problem. Restated, it is hard to be solved in a reasonable time. Therefore, there are many metaheuristics-based schemes for finding near optima of RCPSP were proposed. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) is one of the metaheuristics, and has been verified being an efficient nature-inspired algorithm for many optimization problems. For enhancing the PSO efficiency in solving RCPSP, an effective scheme is suggested. The justification technique is combined with PSO as the proposed justification particle swarm optimization (JPSO), which includes other designed mechanisms. The justification technique adjusts the start time of each activity of the yielded schedule to further shorten the makespan. Moreover, schedules are generated by both forward scheduling particle swarm and backward scheduling particle swarm in this work. Additionally, a mapping scheme and a modified communication mechanism among particles with a designed gbest ratio (GR) are also proposed to further improve the efficiency of the proposed JPSO. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed JPSO provides an effective and efficient approach for solving RCPSP.},

The RCPSP belongs to the NP-hard problem class. To solve this problem a team of asynchronous agents (A-Team) has been implemented using the JABAT multiagent system. An A-Team is the set of objects including multiple agents and the common memory which through interactions produce solutions of optimization problems. These interactions are usually managed by a static strategy. In this paper the dynamic learning strategies are suggested. The proposed strategies based on reinforcement learning supervising interactions between optimization agents and the common memory. To validate the approach and compare strategies computational experiment has been carried out.},

abstract = {Justification is a simple technique which was presented for improving the quality of schedules generated with algorithms for solving RCPSPs. Few researches implemented justification with meta-heuristics and proved that algorithms optimization results using justification outperforms the performance of the same algorithms without justification. In this paper, Stacking Justification is presented for further improvement of generated schedules quality. For testing the performance of this new justification technique, the multiple justification particle swarm optimization (MJPSO) algorithm was developed. Test results show that implementing Stacking Justification in a multiple justification approach was having a significant effect on solutions quality, and the performance results were very effective when compared to best performing algorithms in literature. Additionally, combined priority rules (CPR), a suggested approach for proper spread of swarm particles over several good quality areas within search space during swarm initialization, showed a considerable improvement on results especially for small number of generated schedules which is more suitable for practical applications.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new solution approach to solve the resource-constrained project scheduling problem in the presence of three types of logical constraints. Apart from the traditional AND constraints with minimal time-lags, these precedences are extended to OR constraints and bidirectional (BI) relations. These logical constraints extend the set of relations between pairs of activities and make the RCPSP definition somewhat different from the traditional RCPSP research topics in literature. It is known that the RCPSP with AND constraints, and hence its extension to OR and BI constraints, is NP-hard. The new algorithm consists of a set of network transformation rules that removes the OR and BI logical constraints to transform them into AND constraints and hereby extends the set of activities to maintain the original logic. A satisfiability (SAT) solver is used to guarantee the original precedence logic and is embedded in a metaheuristic search to resource feasible schedules that respect both the limited renewable resource availability as well as the precedence logic. Computational results on two well-known datasets from literature show that the algorithm can compete with the multi-mode algorithms from literature when no logical constraints are taken into account. When the logical constraints are taken into account, the algorithm can report major reductions in the project makespan for most of the instances within a reasonable time.},

This paper proposes a new solution representation and an evolutionary algorithm for solving the RCPSP. The representation scheme is based on an ordered list of events, that are sets of activities that start (or finish) at the same time. The proposed solution methodology, namely SAILS, operates on the event list and relies on a scatter search framework. The latter incorporates an Adaptive Iterated Local Search (AILS), as an improvement method, and integrates an event-list based solution combination method. AILS utilizes new enriched neighborhoods, guides the search via a long term memory and applies an efficient perturbation strategy. Computational results on benchmark instances of the literature indicate that both AILS and SAILS produce consistently high quality solutions, while the best results are derived for most problem data sets.},

For RCPSP, the search was based on an alternated activity and time incrementing process, and all parameters were set after preliminary statistical experiments done on test instances. For MRCPSP, we introduced an original approach using two embedded search loops alternating activity and mode neighbourhood exploration.

Activity durations and costs are assumed as uncertain and modeled as random variables. For the scheduling part of the decision problem, the class of early-start policies is considered. In addition to the schedule, the assignment of execution modes to activities has to be selected. To take risk aversion into account, the approach of optimization under multivariate stochastic dominance constraints, recently developed in other fields, is adopted. For the resulting bi-objective stochastic integer programming problem, the Pareto frontier is determined by means of an exact solution method, incorporating a branch-and-bound technique based on the forbidden set branching scheme from stochastic project scheduling. Randomly generated test instances, partially derived from a test case from the PSPLIB, are used to show the computational feasibility of the approach.},

The optimization objective of MOJSS in this research is to find the best compromising solutions (Pareto non-dominance set) considering multiple criteria, namely makespan, tardiness and mean flow time of the schedules. MOJSS-IWD, which is a modified version of the original IWD algorithm, is proposed to solve the MOJSS problem. A scoring function which gives each schedule a score based on its multiple criteria values is embedded into the MOJSS-IWD's local search process. Experimental evaluation shows that the customized IWD algorithm can identify the Pareto non-dominance schedules efficiently.},

@article{Cucala2012,
abstract = {Energy efficiency is an important concern in for railway administrations and operators. Strategies focused on traffic operation can achieve energy savings in short term and with associated low investments. For that purpose the main strategies are the design of efficient timetables and driving (ecodriving). The ecodriving applies coasting commands (null traction force) to reduce energy consumption, taking into account downhill slopes, speed reductions, etc. (Acikbas and Soylemez, 2008). However, timetable models in literature do not typically consider energy minimization as a goal, and punctuality requirements under uncertainty. In this paper a model for the joint design of ecodriving and timetable under uncertainty for high speed lines is proposed where the railway operator and administrator requirements are incorporated. Uncertainty in delays is modeled as fuzzy numbers and punctuality constraints, and the timetable optimization model is a fuzzy linear programming model, in which the objective function includes the consumptions of delayed scenarios and the behavioral response of the driver that will affect the consumption. The ecodriving design is based on a Genetic Algorithm that makes use of a detailed simulation model, taking into account the specific characteristics of high speed lines and trains. The proposed method is applied to a real Spanish high speed line to optimize the operation and it is compared to the current commercial service in order to evaluate the potential energy savings. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A challenging task in today's food industry is distributing high quality perishable foods throughout the food supply chain. This paper proposes a multi-objective optimization model by integrating sustainability in decision-making, on distribution in a perishable food supply chain network (SCN). It introduces a two-echelon location–routing problem with time-windows (2E-LRPTW) for sustainable SCN design and optimizing economical and environmental objectives in a perishable food SCN. The goal of 2E-LRPTW is to determine the number and location facilities and to optimize the amount of products delivered to lower stages and routes at each level. It also aims to reduce costs caused by carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions throughout the network. The proposed method includes a novel multi-objective hybrid approach called MHPV, a hybrid of two known multi-objective algorithms: namely, multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) and adapted multi-objective variable neighborhood search (AMOVNS). MHPV features two strategies for leader selection procedures (LSP), (i.e. Grids) and crowding distance is compared to common genetic algorithms based on metaheuristics (i.e. MOGA, NRGA and NSGA-II). Results indicate that the hybrid approach achieves better solutions compared to others, and that crowding distance method for LSP outperforms the former Grids method.},

We consider an extension of this class of problems, in which the jobs require the use of additional scarce resources during their execution. A classification scheme for resource constraints is proposed and the computational complexity of the extended problem class is investigated in terms of this classification. Models involving parallel machines, unit-time jobs and the maximum completion time criterion are studied in detail; other models are briefly discussed.},

abstract = {This paper introduces methods for formulating and solving a general class of nonpreemptive resource-constrained project scheduling problems in which the duration of each job is a function of the resources committed to it. The approach is broad enough to permit the evaluation of numerous time or resource-based objective functions, while simultaneously taking into account a variety of constraint types. Typical of the objective functions permitted are minimize project duration, minimize project cost given performance payments and penalties, and minimize the consumption of a critical resource. Resources which may be considered include those which are limited on a period-to-period basis such as skilled labor, as well as those such as money, which are consumed and constrained over the life of the project. At the planning stage the user of this approach is permitted to identify several alternative ways, or modes, of accomplishing each job in the project. Each mode may have a different duration, reflecting the ma...},

abstract = {This paper addresses the Resource Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP). For its solution, a hybrid methodology, which uses a Branch and Bound basic algorithm with dominance rules, is developed and implemented, and is combined with four deterministic heuristics whose objective is to prune the search tree branches, taking into account the iterations available and, at the same time, to minimize the probability of discarding branches that contain optimal solutions. Essentially, these strategies allow the allocation of most iterations to the most promissory regions in an organized manner using only subsets with similar or the same characteristics as those of the optimal solutions at each level of the tree, thus assuring a broad search within the feasible region and, simultaneously, a good exploitation by the selective use of the subsets by level. Finally, the developed algorithm performance is analyzed by solving some of the problems of the PSPLIB test library.},

With regard to the MRCPSP solution consisting of activity sequencing and mode selection, two levels of pheromones are proposed to guide search in the ACO algorithm. Correspondingly, two types of heuristic information and probabilities as well as related calculation algorithms are introduced. Nonrenewable resource-constraint and elitist-rank strategy are taken into account in updating the pheromones. The flowchart of the proposed ACO algorithm is described, where a serial schedule generation scheme is incorporated to transform an ACO solution into a feasible schedule. The parameter-selection and the resultant performance of the proposed ACO methodology are investigated through a series of computational experiments. It is expected to provide an effective alternative methodology for solving the MRCPSP by utilizing the ACO theory.},

abstract = {Scheduling problems is one of the core areas in the planning and development of any project, with a wide applicability to real-world situations. Due to the high complexity of these problems, the solving process is often based on metaheuristics techniques, so that the evaluation of these methods is empirical. Therefore benchmarks, which provide a set of test cases to assess the behavior of algorithms, are generated. This paper extends the PSPLIB library. This extension incorporates to each instance of RCPSP (Resource Constrained Project Scheduling Problem), a realistic mathematical model of energy consumption. This proposal provides an alternative to the current trend in the field of optimization and manufacturing that requires the inclusion of components and methods that reduce the environmental impact in the process of decision making. Finally a new optimality criterion is proposed to compare different search techniques. The PSPLIB-ENERGY is available at http://gps.webs.upv.es/psplib-energy/.},

For this purpose, a number of genes in the receiver genotype absorb one another to have the same order and contiguity they have in the donator genotype. The ability of maintaining up to three contiguous parts from two parents distinguishes this crossover operator from the powerful and famous two-point crossover operator, which can maintain only two contiguous parts, both from the same parent. Comparing the performance of the new procedure with that of other procedures indicates its effectiveness and competence.},

abstract = {The resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) consists of activities that must be scheduled subject to precedence and resource constraints such that the makespan is minimized. It has become a well-known standard problem in the context of project scheduling which has attracted numerous researchers who developed both exact and heuristic scheduling procedures. However, it is a rather basic model with assumptions that are too restrictive for many practical applications. Consequently, various extensions of the basic RCPSP have been developed. This paper gives an overview over these extensions. The extensions are classified according to the structure of the RCPSP. We summarize generalizations of the activity concept, of the precedence relations and of the resource constraints. Alternative objectives and approaches for scheduling multiple projects are discussed as well. In addition to popular variants and extensions such as multiple modes, minimal and maximal time lags, and net present value-based objectives, the paper also provides a survey of many less known concepts.},

Elitist genetic algorithm based on the serial scheme, which was previously developed by the author, is used as a platform to integrate the parallel scheme. Since two schedule generation schemes have different mechanisms, it is meaningful to demonstrate the effects of the scheme on the performance of an algorithm. The ultimate goal of this study is to address the issue with regard to which of the schedule generation schemes will perform better for an arbitrary instance of resource scheduling problems. Thirty problems are solved here to compare their project durations according to the scheme. Scheduling results indicate that Elitist genetic algorithm using the serial scheme provides better solutions than the one using the parallel scheme.},

@article{Debels2007,
abstract = {In the last few decades, the resource-constrained project-scheduling problem has become a popular problem type in operations research. However, due to its strongly NP-hard status, the effectiveness of exact optimisation procedures is restricted to relatively small instances. In this paper, we present a new genetic algorithm (GA) for this problem that is able to provide near-optimal heuristic solutions. This GA procedure has been extended by a so-called decomposition-based genetic algorithm (DBGA) that iteratively solves subparts of the project. We present computational experiments on two data sets. The first benchmark set is used to illustrate the performance of both the GA and the DBGA. The second set is used to compare the results with current state-of-the-art heuristics and to show that the procedure is capable of producing consistently good results for challenging problem instances. We illustrate that the GA outperforms all state-of-the-art heuristics and that the DBGA further improves the performance...},

@article{Kone2011,
abstract = {In this paper we make a comparative study of several mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulations for resource-constrained project scheduling problems (RCPSPs). First, we present three discrete and continuous time MILP formulations issued from the literature. Second, instead of relying on the traditional discretization of the time horizon, we propose MILP formulations for the RCPSP based on the concept of event: the Start/End formulation and the On/Off formulation. These formulations present the advantage of involving fewer variables than the formulations indexed by time. Because the variables of this type of formulations are not function of the time horizon, we have a better capacity to deal with instances of very large scheduling horizon. Finally, we illustrate our contribution with a series of tests on various types of instance with the MILP formulations issued from the literature, together with our new formulations. We also compare our results with a recent RCPSP-specific exact method. We show that, in terms of exact solving, no MILP formulation class dominates the other ones and that a state-of-the art specialized (non-MILP) method for the RCPSP is even outperformed by MILP on a set of hard instances. Furthermore, on another set of hard “highly cumulative” RCPSP instances with a high processing time range, our On/Off formulation outperforms all the others MILP formulations and obtains results close to the ones of the specialized method.},

abstract = {Electrocoagulation (EC) technique is applied for the treatment of waste metal cutting fluids (WMCFs) characterized by high COD and TOC concentration, discharged from metal manufacturing facilities including automotive engine, transmission, and stamping plants. The effects of initial pH, current density and operating time on the performance of EC are investigated by using sacrificial Al and Fe electrodes. Upon treatment by EC, the COD of WMCF is reduced by 93{\%} and the TOC is reduced by 78{\%} for Al electrode at pH 5.0, current density of 60A/m2 and operating time of 25min. For Fe electrode, the reduction in COD is 92{\%} and reduction in TOC is 82{\%} at pH 7.0, current density of 60A/m2 and operating time of 25min. Under optimal operating conditions, the operating costs are calculated as 0.497{\$}/m3 (0.023{\$}/kg removed COD or 0.144{\$}/kg removed TOC) for Fe electrode, and 0.768{\$}/m3 (0.036{\$}/kg removed COD or 0.228{\$}/kg removed TOC) for Al electrode. Fe electrode is found to be more efficient than Al electrode in terms of parameters such as COD and TOC removal efficiencies and operating costs.},

abstract = {The first regulation of the “Energy Efficient Act” for electric motors, launched in 2002, established two sets of minimum efficiency performance standards (MEPS), for ‘standard' (mandatory) and ‘high efficiency' (voluntary) motors. An updated regulation, from the end of 2005 (Edict 553/2005), established the previous high-efficiency MEPS as mandatory for all motors in the Brazilian market. This paper analyses the consequences of this new regulation, which is foreseen to take effect in 2010. These new Brazilian MEPS are compatible with those implemented in other countries. The cost–benefit analysis, considered for different scenarios for industrial consumers, showed that motor substitution (from standard to high efficiency) is generally advantageous. A sample of nine thousand industrial motors has been used, with measured operation in actual conditions, to analyze the investment cost–benefit in three different scenarios. This analysis also demonstrated the benefit of motor substitution, with an average MWh cost from 20 to 35 US{\$}, and with only a few substitutions presenting an unfavorable cost–benefit relationship to the user. We assess that Edict 553 avoided construction of 350MW of hydroelectric capacity. Nevertheless, since the cost of conserved energy for this energy-saving measure is generally below the marginal cost of expansion of the Brazilian electric system, we propose mechanisms to share investment costs among the society as a whole, including demand-side bidding.},

Different types of losses that occur in a motor have been identified and ways to overcome these losses explained. An energy audit that helps to identify motor energy wastages have been discussed extensively. As motors are the major energy users, different energy savings strategies such as use of high-efficient motor, variable speed drive (VSD), and capacitor bank to improve the power factor to reduce their energy uses have reviewed. Different policy measures (i.e. regulatory, voluntary and incentives based) to save motor energy use have been reviewed and presented in this paper. In this review, computer tools that can be used to analyze electric motors energy used has been discussed. Cost parameters to carry out economic analysis have been shown as well. Moreover, payback period for different energy savings strategies have been identified.},

They dominate these grinding applications because greater stress intensity can be delivered in stirred mills and they can achieve better energy efficiency than ball mills in fine and ultra-fine grinding. Investigations were conducted on whether the greater performance of stirred mills over ball mills in fine grinding can be extended to coarse grinding applications. Four different laboratory ball mills and stirred mills have been tested to grind seven ore samples with feed sizes ranging from 3.35mm to 150$\mu$m. A case study on full scale operations of a 2.6MW IsaMill replacing the existing 4MW regrind ball mill at Kumtor Gold Mine in Kyrgyzstan is also included.

abstract = {Stirred media milling is an industrially accepted efficient grinding method for fine and coarse particles. The stirred mills can be operated both in vertical and horizontal configurations and the selection depending on the process variables. Successful operation of horizontal stirred milling (i.e. IsaMill) in wet applications encouraged the studies in dry applications. In this study, series of dry grinding tests were performed in a prototype horizontal stirred mill (42L) to investigate the effects of operating parameters such as stirrer speed, feed rate, media filling and ball size on grinding considering the degree of size reduction and the energy consumption. The test results have shown that the stirrer speed, the media size and the media filling are directly proportional and the feed rate is inversely proportional with the specific energy consumption. Besides, energy savings up to 27{\%} were achieved by adjusting the milling conditions properly (suitable media size) and the size reduction values (F50/P50) were between 1.05 and 2.42.},

The experimental data were obtained by measuring the working parameters of machine tool and the power consumed by the electric motor, for every experience of the experimental program. These data were used in estimation of the coefficients of the models and in their statistic analysis. As an example, the models of efficiency for a vertical-milling machine and of specific consumed energy for milling of an aluminium alloy on this vertical-milling machine are described, ones illustrated.},

abstract = {Hybrid flow shop (HFS) scheduling has been extensively examined and the main objective has been to improve production efficiency. However, limited attention has been paid to the consideration of energy consumption with the advent of green manufacturing. This paper proposes a new ant colony optimization (MOACO) meta-heuristic considering not only production efficiency but also electric power cost (EPC) with the presence of time-of-use (TOU) electricity prices. The solution is encoded as a permutation of jobs. A list schedule algorithm is applied to construct the sequence by artificial ants and generate a complete schedule. A right-shift procedure is then used to adjust the start time of operations aiming to minimize the EPC for the schedule. In terms of theoretical research aspect, the results from computational experiments indicate that the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed MOACO are comparable to NSGA-II and SPEA2. In terms of practical application aspect, the guideline about how to set preference over multiple objectives has been studied. This result has significant managerial implications in real life production. The parameter analysis also shows that durations of TOU periods and processing speed of machines have great influence on scheduling results as longer off-peak period and use of faster machines provide more flexibility for shifting high-energy operations to off-peak periods.},

abstract = {Manufacturing scheduling strategies have historically emphasized cycle time; in almost all cases, energy and environmental factors have not been considered in scheduling. This paper presents a new mathematical programming model of the flow shop scheduling problem that considers peak power load, energy consumption, and associated carbon footprint in addition to cycle time. The new model is demonstrated using a simple case study: a flow shop where two machines are employed to produce a variety of parts. In addition to the processing order of the jobs, the proposed scheduling problem considers the operation speed as an independent variable, which can be changed to affect the peak load and energy consumption. Even with a single objective, finding an optimal schedule is notoriously difficult, so directly applying commercial software to this multi-objective scheduling problem requires significant computation time. This paper calls for the development of more specialized algorithms for this new scheduling problem and examines computationally tractable approaches for finding near-optimal schedules.},

The improved model of milling process as a function of material removal rate and spindle speed has been tested and validated under various cutting parameters. Additionally, the values of the model coefficients are clearly defined, which will be easy to understand and explain each coefficient in the energy consumption model. The model coefficients were obtained using the statistic modelling based on experimental data. Experimental results show that the improved model is able to provide a reliable prediction of energy consumption for given process parameters with an accuracy of more than 96{\%}.

Therefore, this paper proposes an energy-efficient model for flexible flow shop scheduling (FFS). First, a mathematical model for a FFS problem, which is based on an energy-efficient mechanism, is described to solve multi-objective optimization. Since FFS is well known as a NP-hard problem, an improved, genetic-simulated annealing algorithm is adopted to make a significant trade-off between the makespan and the total energy consumption to implement a feasible scheduling. Finally, a case study of a production scheduling problem for a metalworking workshop in a plant is simulated. The experimental results show that the relationship between the makespan and the energy consumption may be apparently conflicting. In addition, an energy-saving decision is performed in a feasible scheduling. Using the decision method, there could be significant potential for minimizing energy consumption.},

For this purpose a structured approach, distinguishing different system scale levels, is applied: starting from a unit process focus, respectively the multi-machine, factory, multi-facility and supply chain levels are covered. Determined by the research contributions reported in literature, the de facto focus of the paper is mainly on energy related aspects of manufacturing. Significant opportunities for systematic efficiency improving measures are identified and summarized in this area.},

HGA introduces several changes in the GA paradigm: a crossover operator specific for the RCPSP; a local improvement operator that is applied to all generated schedules; a new way to select the parents to be combined; and a two-phase strategy by which the second phase re-starts the evolution from a neighbour's population of the best schedule found in the first phase. The computational results show that HGA is a fast and high quality algorithm that outperforms all state-of-the-art algorithms for the RCPSP known by the authors of this paper for the instance sets j60 and j120. And that it is competitive with other state-of-the-art heuristics for the instance set j30.},

abstract = {Evolutionary algorithms, a form of meta-heuristic, have been successfully applied to a number of classes of complex combinatorial problems such as the well-studied travelling salesman problem, bin packing problems, etc. They have provided a method other than an exact solution that will, within a reasonable execution time, provide either optimal or near optimal results. In many cases near optimal results are acceptable and the additional resources that may be required to provide exact optimal results prove uneconomical. The class of project scheduling problems (PSP) exhibit a similar type of complexity to the previous mentioned problems, also being NP-hard, and therefore would benefit from solution via meta-heuristic rather than exhaustive search. Improvement to a project schedule in terms of total duration or resource utilisation can be of major financial advantage and therefore near optimal solution via evolutionary techniques should be considered highly applicable. In preparation for further research this paper reviews the application of evolutionary algorithms to the PSP to date extending previous reviews in this area by also encompassing the study of PSP using the design structure matrix. In order to better examine the coverage of this research, this paper also utilises the PSP classification system proposed by (Herroelen, W., Demeulemeester, E. and de Reyck, B., A note on the paper ?Resource-constrained project scheduling: notation, classification, models and methods? by Brucker et al ., Euro.

abstract = {As projects grow in complexity and size finding realizable schedules which efficiently exploit scarce resources is a challenging task within project management. In this context, the well-known resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) has extensively been studied during the last decades. Considering restricted per-period availabilities of multiple resource types, a project has to be finished as early as possible by performing a set of jobs related by precedence constraints. In particular, for real-world problems with a large number of jobs, heuristics such as priority rule-based procedures as well as approaches based on meta heuristics are among the methods of choice. Traditionally, such heuristics construct a schedule by planning in a forward direction starting from the project's beginning. In this paper, we introduce backward and bidirectional planning strategies. In order to validate their effectiveness these strategies are incorporated into priority rule-based procedures. A comprehensive numerical investigation shows that the performance of such heuristics is considerably increased in particular when using the bidirectional planning. This indicates that such strategies should also be applied within meta heuristic-based procedures.},

abstract = {We consider the multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem (MRCPSP), where a task has different execution modes characterized by different resource requirements. Due to the nonrenewable resources and the multiple modes, this problem is NP-hard; therefore, we implement an evolutionary algorithm looking for a feasible solution minimizing the makespan. In this paper, we propose and investigate two new ideas. On the one hand, we transform the problem of single objective MRCPSP to bi-objective one to cope with the potential violation of nonrenewable resource constraints. Relaxing the latter constraints allows to visit a larger solution set and thus to simplify the evolutionary operators. On the other hand, we build the fitness function not on a priori grid of the bi-objective space, but on an adaptive one relying on clustering techniques. This proposed idea aims at more relevant fitness values. We show that a clustering-based fitness function can be an appealing feature in multi-objective evolutionary algorithms since it may promote diversity and avoid premature convergence of the algorithms. Clustering heuristics require certainly computation time, but they are still competitive with respect to classical niche formation multi-objective genetic algorithm.},

abstract = {In this paper a branch-and-bound procedure is described for scheduling the activities of a project of the PERT/CPM variety subject to precedence and resource constraints where the objective is to minimize project duration. The procedure is based on a depth-first solution strategy in which nodes in the solution tree represent resource and precedence feasible partial schedules. Branches emanating from a parent node correspond to exhaustive and minimal combinations of activities, the delay of which resolves resource conflicts at each parent node. Precedence and resource-based bounds described in the paper are combined with new dominance pruning rules to rapidly fathom major portions of the solution tree. The procedure is programmed in the C language for use on both a mainframe and a personal computer. The procedure has been validated using a standard set of test problems with between 7 and 50 activities requiring up to three resource types each. Computational experience on a personal computer indicates that the procedure is 11.6 times faster than the most rapid solution procedure reported in the literature while requiring less computer storage. Moreover, problems requiring large amounts of computer time using existing approaches for solving this problem type are rapidly solved with our procedure using the dominance rules described, resulting in a significant reduction in the variability in solution times as well.},

In this paper we investigate the relation between the hardness of a problem instance and the topological structure of its underlying network, as measured by the complexity index. We demonstrate through a series of experiments that the complexity index, defined as the minimum number of node reductions necessary to transform a general activity network to a series-parallel network, plays an important role in predicting the computing effort needed to solve easy and hard instances of the multiple resource-constrained project scheduling problem and the discrete time/cost trade-off problem.},

During the processing period of an activity constant amounts of renewable resources are needed where the available capacity of each resource type is limited.

The branching scheme starts from a graph representing a set of conjunctions (the classical finish–start precedence constraints) and disjunctions (induced by the resource constraints). Then it either introduces disjunctive constraints between pairs of activities or places these activities in parallel. Concepts of immediate selection are developed in connection with this branching scheme. Immediate Selection allows to add conjunctions as well as further disjunctions and parallelity relations.

@article{Baar1999,
abstract = {We present two tabu searcl algorithms for the resource-constrained project scheduling problem. Given are n activities which have to be processed without preemptions. During the processing period of an activity constant amounts of renewable resources are needed where the available capacity of each resource type is limited. Furthermore, finish-start precedence relations between the activities are given. The objective is to determine a schedule with minimal makespan. The first tabu search approach relies on elimination of critical arcs and list-scheduling techniques. The second neighborhood is based on schedule schemes, where neighbors are generated by placing activities in parallel or deleting a parallelity relation. Furthermore, a column-generation approach for a linear programming-based lower bound is presented and computational results are reported.},
